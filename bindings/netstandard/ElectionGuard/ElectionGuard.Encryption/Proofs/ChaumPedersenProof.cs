    /// A Chaum-Pedersen proof is a proof that a value `m` is in the range `[0, q)`, where `q` is the
    /// order of the group of the public key. It is used to prove that a value `m` is the plaintext
    /// of a ciphertext `c` encrypted under a public key `p` and a random nonce `k`.
    ///
    /// The proof is a tuple `(c, k, m)`, where `c` is the ciphertext, `k` is the nonce, and `m` is the
    /// plaintext. The proof is valid if `c = p^m * g^k` and `m < q`.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <note>
    /// This is a simplified version of the Chaum-Pedersen proof that does not include a challenge
    /// value. This is sufficient for our use case because the proof is only used to prove that a
    /// value is in the range `[0, q)`, which is a property of the value itself and not of the
    /// prover.
