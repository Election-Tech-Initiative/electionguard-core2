    /// This class accepts a `description_hash` and a `ciphertext` as required parameters
    /// in its constructor.
    ///
    /// When a selection is encrypted, the `description_hash` and `ciphertext` required fields must
    /// be populated at construction however the `nonce` is also usually provided by convention.
    ///
    /// After construction, the `crypto_hash` field is populated automatically in the `__post_init__` cycle

    /// A consumer of this object has the option to discard the `nonce` and/or discard the `proof`,
    /// or keep both values.
    ///
    /// By discarding the `nonce`, the encrypted representation and `proof`
    /// can only be regenerated if the nonce was derived from the ballot's seed nonce.  If the nonce
    /// used for this selection is truly random, and it is discarded, then the proofs cannot be regenerated.
    ///
    /// By keeping the `nonce`, or deriving the selection nonce from the ballot nonce, an external system can
    /// regenerate the proofs on demand.  This is useful for storage or memory constrained systems.
    ///
    /// By keeping the `proof` the nonce is not required footer verify the encrypted selection.
