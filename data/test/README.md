# Test Data

some sample test data generated by running the dotnet decryption tests. You can replace these files by running the tests and grabbing the output that is dumped inot the bin directory of the test executable.

This data is useful for testing client integrations against a key ceremony.

You can regenerate the data in this folder by running `make generate-sample-data` and copying the generated output from the Decryption tests build directory.
